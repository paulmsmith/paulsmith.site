<h1 class="heading-title heading-title--separated">About Paul Smith</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Paul and I am a public focussed designer and coder based just outside my rainy home town of Manchester, England.</p>

<p>I build products and services based on evidence helping organisations respond to the behaviours & raised expectations of users.</p>
<p>I have over 20 years experience, working in agile, multidisciplinary service and product teams.</p>
<p>I'm a designer with a strong technical & software engineering understanding as well as team management skills.</p>

<p>My primary areas of expertise are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interaction Design (UX Design, User Experience Design).</li>
  <li>Product Design (Visual & User Interface Design)</li>
  <li>Design Systems</li>
  <li>Frontend Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these skills I have often worked as Lead Digital Designer for large public and
private organisations such as <a href="https://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>,
<a href="https://nhs.uk">NHS England</a>, <a href="https://toyota.co.uk">Toyota</a>,
 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">DWP</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities">The Ministry for Housing</a> and many other high profile digital and product agencies.</p>
