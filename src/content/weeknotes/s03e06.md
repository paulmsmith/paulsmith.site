## Long week was long

I'll be honest, this week was a bit of a slog. It was my last working week before Christmas and was shockingly cold here in the UK.

I'm ready for a break. I felt like my pace was incredibly slow.

The reality is, I'm performing multiple roles. Designing content, the interaction and then coding the frontend before I'm able to hand anything over to be 'made real' with actual planning data.

## Happenings

- ### Prototyping sources of data

  Prototyping pages to show people which organisations provide data to [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk), their datasets, why they are providing data and where the data was made available.

  We think to be able to trust the service, our users need to know where data comes from and why it is being published.

- ### Talking cyber security and design tools

  I spoke again with Lee, head of digital delivery. We arranged to meet our cyber security assurance team to talk about the [GOVUK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/) and how best to enable designers within our department to access it.

  Suffice to say this sort of thing is tricky. Cyber security is important, there are many examples of when this has been ignored or dismissed as an impediment to delivery only for horrible things to happen later.

  It is also important our teams are able to access the tools and services they need to develop their skills and do their best work.

  I'm going to investigate a middle ground of using [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as the environment for the kit which although not ideal will hopefully appease cyber and IT colleagues worried about staff installing things on official devices.

- ### Started to make a new GOVUK Design System community resource

  I often need to think about or to show other people the 'flow' of a user interaction. Drawing it on paper is quickest but gets messy as you second guess your original ideas or think of different scenarios.

  In the past I created the [GOV.UK Design System Flow Diagrams for Miro](https://github.com/paulmsmith/govuk-designsystem-flow-diagram-miro) which is linked to by the GOVUK Design System on the [resources and tools page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/).

  I was limited to Miro for remote collaboration back then but I now have access to Figma so I'm going to port over what I did which will unlock some powerful improvements I can make to it. I will share it when finished.

## Highlights

- ### My colleagues

  I'm grateful for [Paul](https://blog.whatfettle.com/about/) and Adam two very talented and brilliant people but more importantly, they are also incredibly kind and considerate.

  I'm sure many of us know from experience that brilliance and kindness don't always come as a package deal so I'm grateful when it does because [kindness scales](https://seths.blog/2017/12/kindness-scales/).

- ### A chat with Beth

  Setting up the design community in my department has led me to have conversations with some really interesting people.

  This week I was an interview subject for Beth, a principal designer at [MadeTech](https://madetech.com) hired by the department to do some work with communities of practice as well as to examine how the DLUHC manages [DDaT](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework) job families.

  It was really nice to talk to somebody who understands design in government and some of the issues we face working in the trenches a department.

- ### A nice walk in the snow

  One of the highlights of my week is always taking our dog Ted on a nice long walk. He loves the snow, for some reason he's extra hyper and does lots of zoomies.

  Wrapping up warm to take him out a good way to disconnect for a while.
