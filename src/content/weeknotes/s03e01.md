## Things I did

* I volunteered to run a workshop at [Design Systems Day 2022](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/16/join-us-for-design-system-day-2022/) which is organised by the GOVUK Design System team.

  [Tim Paul tweeted](https://twitter.com/timpaul/status/1589937360912887808?s=20&t=8aIhFjr9mcQDN3IoL1gm7A) they were still looking for people to run workshops so I thought this might be one way I can say thank you and give back.

  I'm going to be talking about lessons I've learnt establishing and working with design systems. I'll use a casestudy to show how we got the backing for a design system and where some things went wrong.

  Hopefully it will inspire attendees to continue to make the case in their organisation for creating a design system but also to have the space to regularly contribute and 'close the circle'.

* Finally managed to give this website a new lick of paint.

  Actually, I have rebuilt it again from the ground up because I wanted to learn a few things. For example, I wanted to try the [Sass Modules system](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/) released in 2019.

  I also took the opportunity simplify the design from the rather whimsical and experimental version I had previously.
* Also this week, Myself and Annie Crabtree organise a bi-weekly design community of practice meeting in [my department](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities), this session we spoke about 'User Centred Policy Design'

   Asking ourselves how might we make connections and share knowledge between people working across policy and digital teams.
* Did some 'Parkrun tourism' and ran at [Salford's Peel Park](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/peel/). Two laps of a relatively flat 5K was deceptively difficult. Probably more in the mind than in the body, seeing the fast runners in the distance was slightly soul destroying.

## Watched

* [Ros Atkins On...](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p095rjk1/ros-atkins-on) I have been enjoying these excellent explainer shows from BBC's Ros Atkins. Thankful for iPlayer becaue they have sheduled these brilliant and informative shows at at incredible inaccessible time for most people.
* [How to use Dual Sim on Iphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lnEQLVOsH4) - A nice video from Apple demonstrating how to use two cellular plans on one iPhone. Something I might have to set-up for my brother who needs to separate his business from his personal life.

## Read

* [Syndicating Content to Twitter](https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/) - With the recent Twitter takeover shenanigans I've been thinking more about how to "Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere" also known as "POSSE". This article talks about how to syndicate to twitter.
* [What is 'Service' in 2021](http://www.making-things-for-others.com/blog/2021/11/10/what-is-service-in-2021) - How can we talk about ‘service’ in a consistent and nuanced way?

## Snapped

* Sunday our Dog Ted turned 2 years old. Gillian went into full doggo-mum overdrive bought him presents and treats to enjoy before we took him on a two hour walk around a very muddy [Rivigton](https://www.visitnorthwest.com/sights/lever-park/).
